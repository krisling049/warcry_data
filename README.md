# warcry_data
A consolidated home for data used by Warcry tools

In this repo you will find json files covering all fighters and abilities in Warcry.  
The _fighters and _abilities files in data/ are considered the source of truth.
fighters.json, abilities.json and the contents of /docs/ are generated from the source of truth files and shouldn't be
manually edited.

The repo also contains tools for loading, manipulating and saving the data in data/.  
Currently, this only exists for python but other languages may be added into their own directories.

The contents of /docs/ is published via github pages.
